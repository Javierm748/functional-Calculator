# Overview

This project is a comprehensive and easy to handle functional calculator. This project demonstrates some of the use case for Erlang language. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The main functionality here is to have a semi graphical interactive display of a calculator where you can imput any operation wether it is addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, then following input the two numbers you would like to be part of the operation and there you have the answer!

The two main purposes for this project is to demonstrate a use for Erland and the other more intrinsic purpose is to have a calculator where we can make operations on.
